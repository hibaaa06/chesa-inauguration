The CHESA Inauguration 2025 website is a responsive single-page design created to celebrate the launch of the Computer Hardware and Electronics Students Association's new academic year. Featuring a clean, modern interface with the association's branding colors, the site prominently displays the event details including date (August 14, 2025), time (8:00 AM IST), and venue. Key sections include an interactive countdown timer, an about CHESA description, the event schedule presented in an elegant timeline format, an RSVP form for attendees, and contact information with social media links. The design prioritizes accessibility and mobile responsiveness while incorporating subtle animations for visual interest. Built with standard web technologies (HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript), the website serves as both an informational hub and participation portal for this important academic event.
